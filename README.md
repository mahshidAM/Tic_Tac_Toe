## Project Description
We created a Tic Tac Toe game thanks to Python.This is a one player game against computer, that is played on a 3Ã—3 square grid. Each player occupies a cell in turns, with the objective of placing three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal pattern.

## Game Rules
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
